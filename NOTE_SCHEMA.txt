NOTE SCHEMA

There are a handful of kinds of notes. 

All notes have a 'type' and a set of data values, mapped through the 'data' portion of the model.Note class.
This data portion defines the content of the note.

All note types have a 'value' field. This value field is different depending on the kind of note that it is.

The defined kinds of notes are:
